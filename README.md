# Java
im just a little young lady who just started fighting with the code works.
i've never done and maybe will never do a fantastic job in this career,but i'm still trying and i still believe in myself.
well,no more hot air,if you are a green hand too, maybe we can share some experience.
or you can give me some encouragement, it doesn't cost a lot.
